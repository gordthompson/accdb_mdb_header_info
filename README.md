# accdb_mdb_header_info

A Windows PowerShell script to identify the file version of an MS Access .accdb or .mdb.

The file is directly opened as a binary file so the Access Database Engine is not required.

**Usage:**

- Download the .ps1 file to a convenient location.
- Right-click the .ps1 file and choose "Run with PowerShell". You will be prompted for the database file to check.
